Anim generation: 'Custom' agents will start with a set kanim ability that remembers preferences chosen at campaign start, and will set to that kanim on every onSpawn. ALSO access the animdef and set it to whatever is saved as the preference.
 escape_mission script will wait for ability use and then save it in agency at end of mission.

Animdefs will have two animdefs (1 male 1 female), but their build and grp tables will (in ability code) have more lines added to them for each body part.

naming format for body part anim files:
[colour]_[part_name].anim
1_face
2_forearm
3_leg
(1-3: skin colours from light to dark)

or
blond_hair
red_hair
brown_hair
black_hair

Process for anim generation:
1. Roll skin colour
2. Roll outfit type and add those parts from skin colour subset
3. Roll hair colour, choose random hairstyle from that category
4. Roll accessories


Genny option:
Linked pigmentation: Dark skin colour will only be matched with dark hair colour
