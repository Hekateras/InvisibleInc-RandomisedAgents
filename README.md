# InvisibleInc-RandomisedAgents

Early WIP mod for Invisible Inc. This mod will have two major parts:

1. Option to start with "randomised" agents and choose their starting items, augments, skills, name and appearance at the start of the campaign, with several custom UI screens
2. A kanim-making resource for modders to use as a base to create unique-looking agents by mixing and matching parts with minimal recolouring/customisation work of their own. I've already uploaded 65 female hair 'builds' in many colours of the rainbow and that's just the start.

For now I am mainly using this repo for anim backup purposes as I focus on the anim part. A better description will come as the mod progresses and potentially becomes ready for collaboration.

If you are a modder, you are welcome to use what assets are already available. Please provide credit and link back to this mod if you use any of the premade sprites here.

## How to use the anim repo

You can make a custom agent by combining body parts from different agents. This assumes you are already familiar with the basics of how to make agent graphics. However, one thing to keep in mind is that when you use sprites (PNG files) for (e.g.) a hairstyle, you want to ALSO copy the lines in the corresponding build.xml file (in the same folder) to the "main" build.xml of your custom agent anim. This usually means replacing the lines that are already there.

(TODO: add links to anim-making resources)
