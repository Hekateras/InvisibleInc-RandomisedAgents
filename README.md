# InvisibleInc-RandomisedAgents

Early WIP mod for Invisible Inc. This mod will have two major parts:

1. Option to start with "randomised" agents and choose their starting items, augments, skills, name and appearance at the start of the campaign, with several custom UI screens
2. A kanim-making resource for modders to use as a base to create unique-looking agents by mixing and matching parts with minimal recolouring/customisation work of their own. I've already uploaded 65 female hair 'builds' in many colours of the rainbow and that's just the start.

For now I am mainly using this repo for anim backup purposes as I focus on the anim part. A better description will come as the mod progresses and potentially becomes ready for collaboration.

If you are a modder, you are welcome to use what assets are already available. Please provide credit and link back to this mod if you use any of the premade sprites here.
